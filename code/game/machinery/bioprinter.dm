	info = {"<h4>Overview</h4>
	<p>The HP 4000 series is a prosthetics fabricator capable of producing mechanical substitutions for organic limbs. It comes with the finest rapid-prototyping
	technology.</p>
	<h4>Operation</h4>
	<p>The machine is relatively easy to operate.<br>
	<b>1st</b> you need to ensure that the machine is in a powered area, and has enough matter stored in it to function.<br>
	As the <b>2nd</b> step, you need to simply activate the machine, and pick which organ you wish to create.<br>
	The <b>final</b> step is simply waiting: the HP 4000 series model prosthetics fabricator will produce a fully functioning, mechanical substitution for the organ selected
	within seconds of receiving input. The substitute organs are ready for transplantation right after the printing is completed!</p>
	<4>Restocking</h4>
	<p>Each printjob requires a set of materials. Should you ever run out of materials, then the HP 4000 series model prosthetics fabricator can be easily restocked by simply
	feeding metal sheets into its receptor port.</p>
